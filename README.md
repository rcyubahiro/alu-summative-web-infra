3. DEMO
A link to a demo video (demonstrating how to use application locally and how to access it online) : https://youtu.be/NJtoPtMzTKs

Open this link to access FitExplorer; http://web-01.yamal.tech or http://web-01.yamal.tech/home

4. Technology used:
Frontend: -HTML: for structuring a webpage -CSS: for styling -JavaScripts
API Interactions:
ExerciseDB API from https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb
Deployment: Deployed on nginx on web-01 server and github pages
5. API INTERACTION
The application integrates with the ExerciseDB API from RapidAPI to access a comprehensive database of exercises. This API provides:

Complete exercise information including names, target muscles, body parts, and equipment 
High-quality demonstration GIFs for each exercise
Structured data for easy filtering and categorization
Real-time access to the latest exercise database
API Documentation: ExerciseDB API Documentation

6. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP
Follow these steps to set up the project for local development: Step 1: Clone this repo: FitExplore. by:

git clone https://github.com/rcyubahiro/
then move inside it by:

cd FitExplore

Step 2: OPEN THE PROJECT: You can simply open the index.html file in your browser as this is a purely front-end application

7. DEPLOYMENT
7.1 Prerequisites

only one web server:

Web-01 (where nginx is installed, and I configured /etc/nginx/sites_available/default, this file is where I hosted my application for instance: I put all my files used to make application including; HTML, CSS, and JS, all were put inside this /var/www/html so that it can be accessed by simply visiting the IP_Address of web-01)

GitHub Pages:

Application is also alternatively, deployed on github pages as it's only way it can be deployed with HTTPS because load balancing with my servers couldn't work due to the issues with web-02 and lb-01 (Link to deployed app on GitHub Pages: https://stevenalu.github.io/fitexplorer/)
7.2 Domain name

A domain used, was created from DotTech domain where I used to link up with the IP_Address so if you vist my domain you will get the same by visiting via IP_Address.
8. DOCKER DEPLOYMENT

This section explains how the FitExplorer web application and load balancer are containerized, built, deployed, and tested using Docker.

Docker Hub Image Details The Docker images are publicly available on my Docker Hub Account https://hub.docker.com/r/stevenalu :

web-01: https://hub.docker.com/r/rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-01/tags

web-02: https://hub.docker.com/r/rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-02/tags

lb-01: https://hub.docker.com/r/rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-lb-01/tags
Once you are in the root of this repo when you clone it where:

https://github.com/waka-man/web_infra_lab
Then:

docker pull rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-01:latest
docker pull rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-02:latest
docker pull rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-lb-01:latest
How to Build: Instructions (Local) Follow this:

docker build -t rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-01:latest -f web/Dockerfile ./web
docker build -t rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-02:latest -f web/Dockerfile ./web
docker build -t rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-lb-01:latest -f lb/Dockerfile ./lb
Run Instructions (on Web01 & Web02) SSHed into each web server and ran:

docker pull rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-01:latest  # on web-01
docker pull rcyubahiro/web_infra_lab-web-02:latest  # on web-02

docker run -d -And after i hasd to reload haproxy inside lb-01 after SSHed into it:

sudo service haproxy restart
Testing steps & evidence From my host machine, I repeatedly ran:

curl -i http://localhost:8082

Screenshot below shows the live process and demo when FitExplorer application hosted on web-01 running on local machine: Screenshot 2025-07-27 001137 image

9. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
API Rate Limiting Challenge: RapidAPI imposes request limits on free tier accounts. solution: upgrading to a paid plan that could be solution in the future
